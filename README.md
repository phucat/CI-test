Google Calendar Development
Arista Networks
===========================

The purpose of this engagement is to deliver an application for the IT staff to push updates to Customerâ€™s Google Calendar environment. The following Google Calendar elements will be updated within this application:

Resource Information
Event Participants

The application will be made available as a web application to specific users within the Arista domain. Authentication and access will be controlled by a Google Group. The primary objectives of this application are to ensure Calendar Resource information updates are pushed to existing Calendar entries and to remove event participants from a Calendar entry once the corresponding user is removed from the Google Environment.

Quick Start Guide
=================

1. In Google Admin settings, include API's scopes

        https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar,
        https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly,
        https://apps-apis.google.com/a/feeds/calendar/resource/#readonly,
        https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.group.readonly,
        https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.orgunit.readonly,
        https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user.readonly

2. In Settings.py update the ff:

        settings['oauth2_service_account'] = {
            'client_email' : 'gserviceaccount.com'
            'private_key': 'key' #must be in pem file
            'developer_key': server_key in public api access
            'domain' : 'clientdomain.com'
            'default_user': 'admin acount'
        }

        settings['google_directory'] = {
            'domain': 'clientdomain.com'
        }

        settings['admin_account'] = {
            'email': 'admin acount',
